# bipartite_matching
Enumerate all maximum matchings in a bipartite graph in Python

Contains functions to enumerate all perfect and maximum matchings in bipartited graph.

Implemented following the algorithms in the paper "Algorithms for Enumerating
All Perfect, Maximum and Maximal Matchings in Bipartite Graphs" by Takeaki Uno,
using numpy and networkx modules of python.

**NOTICE**: optimization needed and use with care, improvement is greatly welcomed.
